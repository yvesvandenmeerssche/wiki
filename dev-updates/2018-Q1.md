# March 2018 - Application releases

- We've put every application online and automated the release process and deployment
    - Again built by Travis CI
    - Hosted on [now.sh](https://zeit.co/now) proxied by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)
    - [Described deployment configuration](https://github.com/windingtree/wiki/blob/master/app-deployment.md)
    and an [example](https://github.com/windingtree/wt-nodejs-api/pull/101)
    - [Improved the cache busting mechanism to prevent stale releases](https://github.com/windingtree/wt-demo-app/pull/100)
    - You can see our apps on [demo.windingtree.com](https://demo.windingtree.com),
    [demo-api.windingtree.com](https://demo-api.windingtree.com) and [mvm.windingtree.com](https://mvm.windingtree.com)
- The demo app can be started against a local network by now command, making fiddling with it very easy

- We're also contributing to Ethereum itself [ERC930 - Eternal Storage Standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/930)

# February 2018 - Library releases

- We've put every library ([LifToken](https://github.com/windingtree/LifToken),
[wt-contracts](https://github.com/windingtree/wt-contracts),
[wt-js-libs](https://github.com/windingtree/wt-js-libs)) in sync by publishing them
in [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/org/windingtree) repository
- Unit testing of the Javascript wrapper library
    - [We were able to speed up the original test suite](https://github.com/windingtree/wt-js-libs/pull/109) from 4 minutes under a second by mocking network with [sinon.js](http://sinonjs.org/)
    - But we've kept the old test suite against a real local network
- Building and publishing
    - Everything is built on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)
    - [Travis also does the publishing for us](https://travis-ci.org/windingtree/wt-js-libs/builds/352436520) and can run slow tests in parallel
    - [Our release process is now publicly described](https://github.com/windingtree/wiki/blob/master/development.md)
    - We agree on using [commitizen](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/) and [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbooks.io/semantic-release/content/#highlights) in the future
