        - pick the right ratePlan(s) based on availableForTravel field and provided booking dates

        - for every rate plan as rp_i
          - for every person as p_j
              apply the best of any fitting price modifiers (pro-consumer strategy, this will change)
              multiply the computed rate by length of stay
          - store the final price for rp_i
